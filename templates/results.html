<h1> Your results </h1>
<p> These results are divided into three sections: how you view others, how you view yourself, and then some
  concluding thoughts and supporting data.</p>

<h2> How do you view others? </h2>
<p> Every person needs a way to understand the differences between people around them. The test you took was designed to assess how you
  make those judgements. The factors you use to judge people are outlined below, and each factor is a combination of different constructs. (You
  can look at the loadings table for a more detailed understanding of how much each label contributes to each factor)
</p>
<p> {% for sentence in paragraph %}
      {{sentence}}<br>
    {% endfor %}</p>

<br>
<h2> How do you view yourself? </h2>
<p> Because you gave ratings of yourself, we can plot you and every you mentioned on the factors listed above.<br>
  Each chart below represents one of the factors you use to judge people, and they match the descriptions above. You are the red
  dot on each line. As you will see, everyone has a standing on each of the factors. </p>

<h2>Is there anything more to my personality?</h2>
<p>While these results are true, they are also a little simplified. In particular, the descriptions of each factor will be a little
  incomplete. The full data tables are below, you can interpret them at your own discretion. Also, please note this is a shortened version of Kelly's original idea.
  If you want the longer version of the test, you can check it out in Kelly's work.</p>

<h2>Can I change how I view others?</h2>
<p>Yes, and the best way is to stop expecting people to fit these patterns. The factors identified in this test reflect how you
  expect others to act. This means we can sometimes let people fit our ideas rather than let them be themselves.<br>
If you want to change, let people surprise you. People won't always act in the same ways. Learning these differences and
noticing people again, giving them a chance to be different, can help you see new things in others.</p>

<h2> Supporting data </h2>
<p>For those interested and/or experienced in factor analysis, the loadings matrix and factor scores are below.
The loadings matrix (on the left) was constructed using factor analysis with an oblimin rotation.
The factor scores matrix (on the right) was used to create the standings charts given above. </p>
