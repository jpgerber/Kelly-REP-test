This project runs the idiographic REP personality test devised by Kelly, providing a customised set of results for each participant. </br>
It's night and day compared to IBM's Watson Personality Project: Watson gives percentile scores on the Big Five, Kelly gives a unique structure for each participant. </br>
My contribution here is to construct a results module that uses data science techniques to <b>automate</b> the interpretation (see sample results page).</br>
The program input takes a fair chunk of time (~30 min) so I am not working (albeit sporadically) on generating data from social media corpora instead and feeding such data directly into the results module (with Andrew Yip).</br>
